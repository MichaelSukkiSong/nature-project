            <p>Resting at the edge of the Arctic Circle, Iceland promises thrill-seeking adventures, dramatic landscapes and an abundance of highlights, waiting to be explored. Iceland is divided into 8 regions, each with their own must-visit highlights.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>In Iceland, you can see the contours of the mountains wherever you go, and the swell of the hills, and always beyond that the horizon. And there’s this strange thing: you’re never sort of hidden; you always feel exposed in that landscape. But it makes it very beautiful as well.-Hannah Kent-</p>

                <p>Located in the Southern Peninsula region of the island, the lava field lies 27 meters above sea level and guarantees amazing landscape photo shoots of the expansive black volcanic terrain</p>

                <img src="resources/img/best-iceland-landscape-photography-locations-Gunnuhver-800x800.jpg" alt="hot springs">
                <p>Located in the southwest part of the Reykjanes peninsula, Gunnuhver is a highly activated geothermal area of mud pools and steam vents. Collectively named after an angry female ghost, the hot springs’ eerie atmosphere is quite picturesque, capturing the steamy sky below the boiling sulfuric mud pools. The colorful minerals cooking in dangerous temperatures of over 300°C (570°F) in the ground create vibrant hues. The steam vents’ grandiose vapor clouds can be captured at various different angles yet be cautious with your step and stay within the designated trails.</p>

                <img src="resources/img/best-iceland-landscape-photography-locations-Krísuvík-Cliffs-800x533.jpg" alt="cliffs">
                <p>Home to thousands of sea birds coming to mate, the birds nestle themselves within the cliffs beside the crashing Atlantic surf. This is a prime location for animal photography within your landscapes. Just a quick hike along the edge of the cliff and you will be able to spot a vast number of species depending on the season, including guillemots, auks, puffins, seagulls, European shags, sandpipers and peewits.</p>

                <h2>Eyjafjallajökull</h2>
                <img src="resources/img/file-628.jpg.webp" alt="Eyjafjallajökull">
                <p>Let’s get the infamous out of the way first shall we? Eyjafjallajökull famously erupted in 2010, disrupting air travel all over the world. In fact the volcano is one of the most active in Iceland, erupting frequently ever since the last glacial period. The Eyjafjallajökull volcano is completely covered by an ice cap that covers an area of over 100 square kilometres. The volcano‘s activity level is listed as moderate but no activity has been detected since the 2010 eruption.</p>

                <h2>Katla</h2>
                <img src="resources/img/file-475.jpg.webp" alt="Katla">
                <p>Another very active one, with twenty eruptions documented between 930 – 1918, although it hasn’t erupted violently in 100 years. Which must mean, you guessed it, that we’re due another one. Due to recent seismic activity, Katla is now on high alert. Katla is also one of the largest volcanoes in Iceland, bigger than its neighbour Eyjafjallajökull, and partially covered with ice. Katla is named after a folkloric figure, a housekeeper thought to be a witch. After murdering a worker who stole her pants she fled to the glacier and immediately caused a flood with her witchcraft.</p>

                <img src="resources/img/historical-tour-of-the-westman-islands-with-domestic-flight-1300x879.jpg.webp" alt="cliffs">
                <p>Eldfell is a volcanic cone that was formed in the surprise eruption in Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) in 1973. The eruption began with no warning and would go on for five months, destroying around 400 homes on Heimaey Island and nearly causing its permanent evacuation. After the eruption islanders used the heat from the lava to provide hot water and generate electricity.</p>
