                <p>Resting at the edge of the Arctic Circle, Iceland promises thrill-seeking adventures, dramatic landscapes and an abundance of highlights, waiting to be explored. Iceland is divided into 8 regions, each with their own must-visit highlights.</p>

            <h2>Georaphy</h2>
            <p>Iceland is the world's 18th largest island, and Europe's second-largest island after Great Britain. The main island is 101,826 km2, but the entire country is 103,000 km2 in size, of which 62.7% is tundra. About 30 minor islands are in Iceland, including the lightly populated Grímsey and the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. Lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface, only 23% is vegetated.</p>

                <h2>Stampahraun Lava Field</h2>
                <p>Located in the Southern Peninsula region of the island, the lava field lies 27 meters above sea level and guarantees amazing landscape photo shoots of the expansive black volcanic terrain</p>

                <title>Gunnuhver Hot Springs</title>
                <p>Located in the southwest part of the Reykjanes peninsula, Gunnuhver is a highly activated geothermal area of mud pools and steam vents. Collectively named after an angry female ghost, the hot springs’ eerie atmosphere is quite picturesque, capturing the steamy sky below the boiling sulfuric mud pools. The colorful minerals cooking in dangerous temperatures of over 300°C (570°F) in the ground create vibrant hues. The steam vents’ grandiose vapor clouds can be captured at various different angles yet be cautious with your step and stay within the designated trails.</p>

                <title>Krísuvík Cliffs</title>
                <p>Home to thousands of sea birds coming to mate, the birds nestle themselves within the cliffs beside the crashing Atlantic surf. This is a prime location for animal photography within your landscapes. Just a quick hike along the edge of the cliff and you will be able to spot a vast number of species depending on the season, including guillemots, auks, puffins, seagulls, European shags, sandpipers and peewits.</p>
